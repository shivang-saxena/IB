/*
Repeated Subtraction
You are given 2 numbers P and Q. An operation on these 2 numbers is defined as follows: Take the smaller number of the 2 numbers and subtract it from the bigger number. Keep performing this operation till either of the following criterion is met:
Both numbers become equal.
Either of the number becomes 0.
Find the sum of the final values of P and Q. Constraints:
 0 <= P,Q <= 1e9
Input:
Two integers P and Q
Output:
Sum of the final values of P and Q
Example: Input:
P : 5 
Q : 15
Output:
10
Explanation:
For the first operation, smaller of P and Q is P.
So we subtract P from Q which gives us the new values of P and Q as 5 and 10 resp.
For the second operation, smaller of P and Q is P.
So we subtract P from Q which gives us the new values of P and Q as 5 and 5 resp.
Since the values of P and Q are now same, we output the sum of these values=10.

/*
Solution Approach
The answer will be 2*(greatest common divisor of P and Q).
Consider this for any two prime numbers, we will always reach a point where one number will be reduced to 0 and the other to 1.
Similarly, for any two numbers (not necessarily prime), one of P and Q will reach the greatest number that divides both P and Q
while the other might be 0 or the greatest number that divides both P and Q itself.
Working out a few cases on pen paper helps you reach this conclusion too.
